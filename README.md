# docks
How I use (and extend) other people's docker containers - because sometimes they aren't container enough for me.

# What is it?
This is just a collection of some of the freely available docker images I use (and possibly abuse) to my own ends.
Most stuff is exceptionally simple, with only very minor changes. I just don't want to have to think about how to do it all again. Yaaaaay VCS!

# Should you use it?
Sure. Go for it.

# Should you update it?
Why not?

# Should you fork it and use it for your nefarious purposes?
Yeah. That's how I got here.

# Who's is it?
I'm just extended stuff here, so it's not really mine - it's the "other people's" stuff, really.
